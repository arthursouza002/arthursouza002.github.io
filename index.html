      <p>Hello, My name is Arthur Souza. This is my Draft Site for CSC106 Computer Programming. I personally coded everything on this website given the information in class and by rewatching a lot of KhanAcademy Videos. You can also find attached links to my "Javscript" page where you can find the forum of all my coded Javascripts for class. The link to "Apps" where I will upload any applications that will run on phones. Finally my "About Me" Page where you can find information about your truly. </p>
